# Portfolio

This is my portfolio for the work that I've done at Rutgers Coding Bootcamp.  The portfolio contains an about me section with a brief summary of who I am,  a project section that contains some of my best projects from the Bootcamp, a contact page to be connected to the backend in the future, and a resume page where you can download my resume.

I hope you enjoy.  Feel free to contact me directly, or check out my GitHub repository, Linkedin, and Stack Overflow pages by clicking the links in the footer.
